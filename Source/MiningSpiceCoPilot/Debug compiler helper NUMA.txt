## IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
The NUMA-Aware Registry Access implementation integrates Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) awareness into the core registry and threading systems, optimizing performance on multi-socket server hardware. The implementation includes:

1. **NUMA Topology Detection and Management**:
   - FNUMATopology class for hardware topology detection
   - FNUMADomainInfo struct for tracking physical cores and memory domains
   - Domain-to-thread assignments with memory locality optimization
   - Detection of inter-domain access costs for optimal task placement

2. **NUMA-Local Type Caching**:
   - Per-domain local type caches to minimize cross-socket memory traffic
   - Domain-specific cache management with memory footprint controls
   - Access pattern tracking to identify frequently used types
   - Automatic cache invalidation and version tracking for consistency

3. **Thread Affinity Management**:
   - Thread-to-domain pinning APIs
   - Optimized thread selection for domain-specific operations
   - Migration tracking to measure performance impact of domain changes
   - NUMA-optimized spin locks for domain-aware thread prioritization

4. **Zone-to-NUMA Domain Assignment**:
   - Intelligent zone placement based on material distribution
   - Access pattern tracking for zone operations
   - Migration capabilities to rebalance zones across domains
   - Automatic zone rebalancing for optimal throughput

5. **NUMA-Aware Service Resolution**:
   - Domain-specific service instances for high-traffic services
   - Transparent service replication across domains
   - Optimistic thread-local caching with version validation
   - Service locality optimization based on usage patterns

This implementation provides significant performance benefits on multi-socket systems, reducing cross-socket memory traffic, minimizing cache coherency overhead, and ensuring optimal thread and data locality for mining operations.

## PRESETUP

### Successes from previous attempts:
- This is the first attempt

### Persistent Issues:
- Singleton pattern implementation in FMaterialRegistry is incomplete
- Missing required class members and initialization flags
- Static vs non-static method calls not properly implemented
- Type conversion issues in TypeRegistrationOperation.cpp
- Illegal qualified name in TaskScheduler.cpp

### Lessons:
- Need to ensure singleton patterns are implemented with proper static members
- Class member initialization and declaration must be consistent

### Plan for fixing the issues:
1. Fix the FMaterialRegistry singleton implementation by adding missing static members
2. Add missing member variables (NextChannelId, MaterialTypeMap, RelationshipMap, etc.)
3. Fix static vs non-static method calls in singleton access
4. Add proper constructor for FMaterialTypeInfo to handle FName conversion
5. Fix the Max qualifier issue in TaskScheduler.cpp

## POSTSETUP

#### Fixes Attempted:
```cpp
// 1. Add proper singleton implementation to MaterialRegistry.h
// Changed from:
class MININGSPICECOPILOT_API FMaterialRegistry
{
public:

    return *Singleton;
}

bool FMaterialRegistry::IsInitialized()
{
    return Get().bIsInitialized;
}

void FMaterialRegistry::Initialize()
{
    if (bIsInitialized)
    {
        return;
    }
    bIsInitialized = true;
    // ... initialization code
}

// 3. Fix TaskScheduler.cpp Max issue
// Changed from:
const int32 FThreadPoolTaskScheduler::Max = 4;

// To:
const int32 FThreadPoolTaskScheduler::MaxThreads = 4;
```

#### Theory:
```
The main issue appears to be around the implementation of the singleton pattern in FMaterialRegistry:

- The key problem is that the class was incorrectly implemented as a singleton - it was missing static instance pointers, initialization flags, and proper static accessor methods.
- The static method Get() needs to be implemented to properly create and return the singleton instance.
- Multiple member variables were referenced but not declared in the class definition.
- The TaskScheduler was using 'Max' as a member name which conflicts with UE5's global Max utility function.

These fixes address the static vs. instance member access issues by:
1. Adding proper static members for singleton management
2. Implementing the Get() method correctly to initialize the singleton on first access
3. Adding missing member variables that were being referenced
4. Converting direct singleton member accesses to use the Get() method
5. Renaming the conflicting Max variable to avoid namespace issues
```

## PRESETUP

### Successes from previous attempts:
- Attempt 1 established the basic singleton structure for MaterialRegistry
- FThreadSafeBool is being used for thread-safe initialization
- Proper locking mechanisms with FScopedSpinLock are in place

### Persistent Issues:
- Member variables are being redefined in the MaterialRegistry class
- There appears to be a duplicate section in the MaterialRegistry.h header
- MaterialTypeHierarchy is defined with different types in different places
- Static counters and locks are being redefined

### Lessons:
- Need to check for duplicate member definitions in the class declaration
- Need to ensure that all singleton-related members are properly declared only once
- Class members should be declared once with consistent types

### Plan for fixing the issues:
1. Examine MaterialRegistry.h to identify and remove duplicate member declarations
2. Fix MaterialTypeHierarchy to have a consistent type definition
3. Ensure that static members are properly declared only once
4. Check for proper #pragma once and include guards to prevent header issues

## POSTSETUP

#### Fixes Attempted:
```cpp
// 1. Fix duplicate member definitions in MaterialRegistry.h
// There appears to be a second declaration or section of member variables around line 968
// Changed from:
    TMap<uint32, TSharedRef<FMaterialTypeInfo, ESPMode::ThreadSafe>> MaterialTypes;
    TMap<FName, uint32> MaterialTypeNameMap;
    // ... other duplicate member declarations

// To:
    // Remove duplicate section entirely, keeping only the first declaration

// 2. Fix MaterialTypeHierarchy type consistency
// Changed from:
    // Two declarations with different types
    TMap<uint32, TArray<uint32>> MaterialTypeHierarchy; // at line 913
    // ... some other type at line 974

// To:
    // Keep only one consistent declaration:
    TMap<uint32, TArray<uint32>> MaterialTypeHierarchy;

// 3. Fix static member duplications
// Changed from:
    FThreadSafeCounter NextTypeId; // Declared twice
    FThreadSafeCounter NextRelationshipId; // Declared twice
    uint32 CurrentSchemaVersion; // Declared twice
    FSpinLock RegistryLock; // Declared twice

// To:
    // Keep only the first declaration of each
```

#### Theory:
```
The primary issue appears to be duplicate member declarations in the MaterialRegistry.h file. This is likely caused by:

1. A duplicate section in the header file - possibly added during refactoring or merging code
2. The MaterialTypeHierarchy is defined twice with different types, which is causing a conflict
3. Multiple static members are being redefined

The solution is to identify and remove these duplications, ensuring each member is defined exactly once with a consistent type. The error C2086 indicates redefinition of the same variable, while C2371 indicates that a variable is being redefined with a different type.

By fixing these duplicate definitions, we should resolve the primary compilation errors without changing the actual functionality of the code. This is a structural/organizational fix rather than a functional one.

```

## PRESETUP

### Successes from previous attempts:
- Attempt 1 established the basic singleton structure for MaterialRegistry
- Attempt 2 fixed duplicate member declarations in MaterialRegistry.h
- Proper locking mechanisms with FScopedSpinLock are in place
- Fixed redefinition errors for various members

### Persistent Issues:
- Several member variables are being used but are undeclared (MaterialPropertyMap, MaterialTypeMap)
- TMultiMap operator[] usage is incorrect (line 531)
- FMaterialRelationship is missing members SourceTypeName and TargetTypeName
- Issues with Map operations for adding elements and finding values
- 'MultiFind' method is being called on TMap which doesn't have this method

### Lessons:
- Need to ensure all member variables are properly declared before use
- Ensure proper map access methods are used for different map types (TMap vs TMultiMap)
- Need to check struct definitions for missing members
- Pay attention to proper usage of container methods
- Need to handle adding elements to maps with array values correctly

### Plan for fixing the issues:
1. Add missing member variables to FMaterialRegistry class (MaterialPropertyMap, MaterialTypeMap)
2. Fix the TMultiMap access by using the proper method instead of operator[]
3. Add missing members to FMaterialRelationship struct or update the property access
4. Fix the Map operations with proper argument types and method calls
5. Implement a custom MultiFind helper function for regular maps with array values
6. Fix referenced but uninitialized variable 'ChildProperties'

    const TArray<ValueType, Allocator>* FoundValues = Map.Find(Key);
    if (FoundValues)
    {
        OutValues = *FoundValues;
    }
    else
    {
        OutValues.Empty();
    }

{
    ChildProperties = MaterialPropertyMap[InParentPropertyId];
}
```

#### Theory:
```
The main issues in this codebase are related to missing member declarations and improper usage of container operations:

1. Missing member variables: The implementation file references map structures (MaterialPropertyMap, MaterialTypeMap) that aren't declared in the class. Adding these declarations should fix the "undeclared identifier" errors.

2. TMultiMap access: The code is attempting to use operator[] on a TMultiMap, but this operator isn't defined for TMultiMap. Using the MultiFind method instead should resolve this issue.

3. Missing struct members: The FMaterialRelationship struct is missing members SourceTypeName and TargetTypeName. Adding these fields will fix the "is not a member of" errors.

4. Map operations with arrays: The code is trying to directly add values to map entries where the value type is an array. The correct approach is to first check if the key exists, and if not, create a new array with the value; otherwise, add the value to the existing array.

5. Custom MultiFind: The code is calling MultiFind on a regular TMap with array values, but this method only exists on TMultiMap. We need to implement a helper function that provides the same functionality for regular maps.

6. Uninitialized reference: The code is creating a reference to a map value without first ensuring that the key exists. We need to initialize the reference properly to avoid the "references must be initialized" error.

These fixes should address the compilation errors while maintaining the intended functionality of the code.

```

## PRESETUP

### Successes from previous attempts:
- Implemented basic singleton structure for MaterialRegistry
- Fixed redefinition errors for various members
- Removed duplicate member declarations
- Added proper implementations for static methods in the singleton pattern
- Added missing member variables to support functionality

### Persistent Issues:
- FMaterialPropertyInfo is undeclared causing template errors
- Mismatch between storage type (FMaterialTypeInfo vs TSharedRef<FMaterialTypeInfo>)
- TMultiMap operator[] usage is still incorrect
- TypeRelationships is undeclared
- Type conversion issues between pointers to different types

### Lessons:
- Forward declarations of structs are needed before they're used in template containers
- Container value types need to match exactly between declaration and implementation
- TMultiMap does not support operator[] and must use MultiFind instead
- Need to ensure member variables are properly declared before use
- Need to be careful with shared reference types versus direct value types

### Plan for fixing the issues:
1. Add forward declaration for FMaterialPropertyInfo struct before it's used
2. Fix map type declarations to ensure consistency (either using TSharedRef or direct types)
3. Properly declare the TypeRelationships member variable
4. Replace TMultiMap operator[] usage with MultiFind
5. Fix type conversion issues by ensuring consistent types in Find/Add operations

MaterialTypeMap.Add(NewTypeId, MakeShared<FMaterialTypeInfo, ESPMode::ThreadSafe>(TypeInfo));
```

#### Theory:
```
The primary issues in this code relate to:

1. Missing forward declarations: FMaterialPropertyInfo is being used before it's declared
   - This causes template instantiation failures when used in containers like TMap

2. Type inconsistency: The code mixes FMaterialTypeInfo direct type with TSharedRef<FMaterialTypeInfo>
   - This causes conversion errors when trying to store or retrieve values

3. Improper TMultiMap usage: TMultiMap doesn't support operator[] and must use MultiFind instead
   - Must use MultiFind method to get values instead

4. Missing member declaration: TypeRelationships is used but not declared

5. Type conversion issues in Find/Add operations:
   - When using Find() on a map where value is a shared reference, the result needs
     to be handled differently than when the value is a direct type
   - Similarly, when adding to a map with shared reference values, we need to create
     proper shared references

These issues all stem from inconsistency between the declaration of the containers
and how they're being accessed in the implementation file. By ensuring type consistency
and proper container usage, we should fix the compilation errors.

```

## PRESETUP

### Successes from previous attempts:
- Fixed forward declarations for key types (FMaterialPropertyInfo, FMaterialTypeInfo, FMaterialRelationship)
- Implemented FMaterialPropertyInfo struct
- Fixed consistency issues with TMap declarations
- Changed MaterialTypeMap type from TMap<uint32, FMaterialTypeInfo> to TMap<uint32, TSharedRef<FMaterialTypeInfo, ESPMode::ThreadSafe>>
- Fixed MaterialPropertyMap to use correct type (TMap<FName, TSharedPtr<FMaterialPropertyBase>>)
- Updated GetMutableMaterialTypeInfo to use ESPMode::ThreadSafe
- Fixed AllocateChannelMemory to use proper ESPMode::ThreadSafe shared references

### Persistent Issues:
- Type inconsistencies between MaterialTypeMap and other functions
- Improper TMultiMap usage attempting to use operator[]
- Missing TypeRelationships member used in GetMaterialRelationships
- Inconsistent ESPMode::ThreadSafe usage across member variables and methods

### Lessons:
- When using shared references, ESPMode::ThreadSafe needs to be consistent throughout the codebase
- TMultiMap does not support operator[] access, must use MultiFind instead
- MaterialTypeMap and MaterialTypes both need same type (TSharedRef<FMaterialTypeInfo, ESPMode::ThreadSafe>)
- Converting between different container types requires explicit handling

### Plan for fixing the issues:
1. Update all instances of TSharedRef<FMaterialTypeInfo> and TSharedRef<FMaterialRelationship> to include ESPMode::ThreadSafe
2. Fix TMultiMap access replacing operator[] with MultiFind
3. Replace TypeRelationships references with MaterialTypeHierarchy
4. Fix Find/Add operations to handle type conversions properly with shared references
5. Ensure consistent property map access

const TSharedRef<FMaterialRelationship, ESPMode::ThreadSafe>* RelationshipPtr = RelationshipMap.Find(RelationshipId);

// 8. Updated method declarations to match implementations
// Changed from:
void AllocateChannelMemory(const TSharedRef<FMaterialTypeInfo>& TypeInfo);

// To:
void AllocateChannelMemory(const TSharedRef<FMaterialTypeInfo, ESPMode::ThreadSafe>& TypeInfo);
```

#### Theory:
```
The primary issues in this code relate to type consistency and shared reference usage:

1. The FMaterialPropertyInfo struct was undeclared, causing compilation errors when used as a template parameter. We implemented this struct with all necessary members.

2. There was inconsistency in the container types - sometimes the code was using direct FMaterialTypeInfo objects and sometimes TSharedRef<FMaterialTypeInfo>. We standardized on TSharedRef<FMaterialTypeInfo, ESPMode::ThreadSafe> throughout.

3. The MaterialPropertyMap was incorrectly defined. It should be a nested map structure (TMap<uint32, TMap<FName, TSharedPtr<FMaterialPropertyBase>>>) to store properties by type ID and property name.

4. The code was trying to use operator[] on TMultiMap, which is not supported. We replaced these with MultiFind calls.

5. There was a reference to TypeRelationships that wasn't declared in the class. After analysis, it appears this should be using MaterialTypeHierarchy instead.

6. Through all our changes, we maintained thread safety by consistently using ESPMode::ThreadSafe for shared references. This is important because the code uses locks (FScopedSpinLock) to protect concurrent access.

These fixes ensure type consistency throughout the codebase, maintain thread safety through proper shared reference usage, and fix container access patterns to use the correct methods.
