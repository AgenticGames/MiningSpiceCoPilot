ICON LEGEND:
Core Feature Icons (Items with this icon are 100% in the scope of the original system prompt --> Example, this one (Source\MiningSpiceCoPilot\# SYSTEM 2 Memory Management System REFINED.txt)):

‚öôÔ∏è - Required System Component / Core Integration Feature / Essential Functionality 

Stretch Goal Icons (Beyond the scope of the original implementation and connection points of the system prompt documents):

Comprehensive list of integration points between the Core Registry (System1) and Memory Management System (System2) with specific function/member references (Each section should have at LEAST 6 entries, Core integration + Visualization & Telemetry having at least 8, list them in importance order, if appropriate you can make more per section (As a bonus, each category gets an extra 2 items that will heavily benefit the SVO/SDF system itself, mark these with an extra icon üßä)):

## TEMPLATE ENTRY FOR INTEGRATION CHECKLIST (Dont need to follow it religiously, just a guide)

1. ‚öôÔ∏è **TEMPLATE DESCRIPTIVE NAME** 
   - `TEMPLATECLASS::TEMPLATEFUNCTION` needs synchronization with `FUNCTION` from `HEADER.h`
   - Implementation: 
     - In `TEMPLATECLASS::TEMPLATEFUNCTION`, replace `FUNCTION` with `FUNCTION2` from `HEADER.h`
     - Update `PoolsLock` member to use `FSpinLock` instead of `FRWLock`
     - Add contention tracking for memory pool creation using `FThreadSafety::RecordContention()`, allowing for xyz improvement
     - Required files: `MemoryPoolManager.cpp`, `MemoryPoolManager.h`, `ThreadSafety.h`
      - Laymans terms, relate it to mining game when possible.
